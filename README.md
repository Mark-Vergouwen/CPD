# üîå Smart EV Charging Session Detection using Change Point Detection
This repository provides tools to detect, classify, and visualize electric vehicle (EV) charging sessions based on high-frequency household electricity load data. The analysis combines changepoint detection with heuristics to identify charging behavior and allows scaleability across thousands of smart meter profiles.

## üîß Disclaimer: Work in Progress
This repository is currently under active development and should be considered a work in progress. The methods, code, and results are preliminary and may change substantially. This repository does not represent final or peer-reviewed scientific work.

## üöÄ Overview
With the increasing penetration of EVs and smart meters, understanding when and how charging occurs is key to enabling demand-side flexibility and optimizing grid usage. This project helps:

- **Detect EV charging sessions** from noisy load profiles using changepoint detection and load thresholds.
- **Visualize sessions** by week (or month) and household, as well as across households
- **Handle multiple households** in a scalable and customizable way.

## üì¶ Features
- ‚ö° Changepoint detection using [`ruptures`](https://github.com/deepcharles/ruptures)
- üîç Heuristics to classify detected changepoints as charging start or end events
- üóìÔ∏è Weekly visualization of sessions for multiple households
- üìä Modular plotting per household, per week, or monthly overview
