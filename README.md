# 🔌 Smart EV Charging Session Detection using Change Point Detection
**NOTE: this repository is currently work-in-progress. Not all functionality may yet be present**

This repository provides tools to detect, classify, and visualize electric vehicle (EV) charging sessions based on high-frequency household electricity load data. The analysis combines changepoint detection with heuristics to identify charging behavior and allows scaleability across thousands of smart meter profiles.

## 🚀 Overview
With the increasing penetration of EVs and smart meters, understanding when and how charging occurs is key to enabling demand-side flexibility and optimizing grid usage. This project helps:

- **Detect EV charging sessions** from noisy load profiles using changepoint detection and load thresholds.
- **Visualize sessions** by week (or month) and household, as well as across households
- **Handle multiple households** in a scalable and customizable way.

## 📦 Features
- ⚡ Changepoint detection using [`ruptures`](https://github.com/deepcharles/ruptures)
- 🔍 Heuristics to classify load spikes as charging start or end events
- 🗓️ Weekly visualization of sessions for multiple households
- 🎨 Smart colormaps for session duration
- 📊 Modular plotting per household, per week, or monthly overview
